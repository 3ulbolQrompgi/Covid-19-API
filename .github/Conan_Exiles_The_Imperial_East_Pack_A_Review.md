The Imperial East Pack is a Khitan-themed DLC that introduces a new set of building pieces, armors, weapons, warpaints and placeables inspired by the eastern lands of Khitai. Khitai is a fictional country in the Conan lore, based on ancient China and other Asian cultures. The DLC aims to give players more options and variety in customizing their constructions and characters.
 
The DLC contains 39 new Khitan building pieces that have the same stats as existing tier three pieces. They have a distinctive oriental style with curved roofs, ornate decorations and dragon motifs. The building pieces can be used to create palaces, castles, temples or any other structure you can imagine.
 
The DLC also contains 15 new armor pieces in three sets: Khitan Mercenary, Khitan Captain and Khitan Imperial. Each set has a light, medium and heavy version, as well as an epic end-game version. The armors have a unique design that reflects the culture and history of Khitai. They are mostly made of leather, silk, metal and jade. The armors also offer different bonuses and protection depending on the type and quality.
 
In addition, the DLC offers 9 new weapons in one Khitan weapon set. The weapons have the same power as iron weapons with an epic end-game version of each weapon. The weapons include swords, axes, maces, clubs, spears, daggers, bows and shields. The weapons have a sleek and elegant appearance that matches the Khitan style.
 
Furthermore, the DLC includes 5 new warpaints in Khitan style. Warpaints are decorative tattoos that can be applied to your character's body and face. They can also provide some buffs or effects depending on the type of warpaint. The warpaints in this DLC are based on Khitan symbols and colors such as jade, black, white and red.
 
Finally, the DLC features 25 new placeables that can be created at an all new Khitan Artisan station. Placeables are items that can be placed in your base or environment for decoration or functionality. The placeables in this DLC range from braziers, cauldrons, carpets, tables, lamps, screens, idols, statues, drums and more. They have a rich and detailed look that adds more flavor and atmosphere to your base.
 
The Imperial East Pack is a great addition to Conan Exiles that expands the game's content and diversity. It gives players more options and choices in building their own empire and expressing their creativity. It also adds more immersion and lore to the game world by introducing a new culture and style. The DLC is worth buying if you are a fan of Conan Exiles and want to experience more of what the game has to offer.
