Polnareff has a strong attraction to the opposite sex and often flirts with women he meets. He has a somewhat inflated ego and likes to admire his own appearance, especially his hair, which he considers his best feature. He is easily distracted by a woman's beauty and can lose focus on important matters if he sees a pretty face, which makes Joseph remark that Polnareff's brain is located below his waist.[10] Even when he was turned into a baby by Alessi, he still enjoyed being in the company of a gorgeous woman. Polnareff is usually very observant and alert in combat, being able to detect the presence of enemies like Devo,[20] Chaka, and Alessi,[21] but he seems to have a blind spot when it comes to women. He never suspects that a woman could be a Stand user or an enemy, and he trusts Nena[22] and Enya[23] without hesitation. Polnareff is also very friendly and courteous with the women he encounters, offering them romantic advice or trying to make them laugh (although this sometimes backfires, as in the case of Enya).[23]

Polnareff is a loyal and courageous friend who values his companions above all else. He joins the Joestar group in order to avenge his sister Sherry, who was brutally murdered by J. Geil, the user of the Hanged Man.[24] He is determined to find and kill J. Geil, even if it means putting himself or his allies in danger.[25] He also seeks to honor the memory of his friend Avdol, who sacrificed himself to save Polnareff from Hol Horse.[26] Polnareff is willing to risk his life for his friends and often acts as a shield or a decoy to protect them from harm.[27][28][29]
  
Polnareff has a playful and humorous personality, often cracking jokes or making fun of his enemies. He likes to tease Joseph and Jotaro, calling them "gramps" and "Jotaro-kun" respectively.[30][31] He also enjoys playing video games with Kakyoin,[32] having a friendly rivalry with him. Polnareff is not afraid to express his emotions, whether it is anger, sadness, fear, or joy. He often cries when he is moved or when he remembers his fallen friends.[33][34][35] He also has a strong sense of justice and morality, refusing to kill innocent people or animals.[36][37]
  
Polnareff is a skilled and versatile Stand user, wielding Silver Chariot, a sword-wielding Stand that can move and attack at incredible speeds. Polnareff can control Silver Chariot with great precision and accuracy, using it to deflect bullets,[38] cut through objects,[39] or create afterimages.[40] He can also remove Silver Chariot's armor to increase its speed even further, but at the cost of its defense.[41] Polnareff is adept at using his environment to his advantage, such as creating sparks with his sword,[42] using mirrors to confuse his opponents,[43] or hiding in the shadows.[44] He is also able to improvise and adapt to different situations, such as using his own blood as a weapon,[45] using his earrings as projectiles,[46] or using his Stand's rapier as a prosthetic leg.[47]
